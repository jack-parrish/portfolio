            <h2>Some context</h2>
            <p>Spaces like college campuses and convention centers can often feel dauting or congested, with thousands of people navigating through them. These spaces have multiple buildings, floors, and indoor and outdoor components, not to mention a ton of different events happening all at once.  It's easy for someone new to feel intimidated or uncomfortable.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="research">
            <h2>So what makes these spaces hard to feel comfortable in?</h2>
            <p>To try to find an answer to this question, as well as understand the surrounding context in which users interact with these spaces, I conducted 6 user interviews.</p>
            <p>I decided to focus on new college students and professional conference attendees, because both colleges and conferences are already tech-heavy events and these users would likely benefit the most from a mobile app.</p>

            <p>I used what I learned in my interviews to map the "as is" user journey and create two personas.</p>

            <h2>How might a new mobile app help?</h2>
            <p>Based on my research, I knew my design solution needed to help save time, help build familiarity, and help people of all mobilities get where they need to go.  After some How Might We and Crazy Eights exercises, I decided to design a navigation app that could work both indoors and outdoors.</p>
            <p>I conducted a competitive audit of other navigation apps to identify what works well, and where my app has a chance to stand out from the crowd:</p>
