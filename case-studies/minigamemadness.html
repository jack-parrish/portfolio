            <h2>What's the business need?</h2>
            <p>Unengaging meeting drain employees off their energy, brainpower, and stamina, costing billions across the US economy each year.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, since the pandemic started, the number of meetings at work has jumped 10%, or about 3 extra meetings per week, per employee.</p>
            <p><strong>If meetings are here to stay, there is a need to help keep everyone engaged and productive during them.</strong></p>

            <h2>What makes a meeting effective?</h2>
            <p>I asked 4 of my coworkers at Epic, who collectively schedule and attend dozens of meetings every week, about their experience leading and participating in meetings.  I was interested in hearing what they thought worked, what their favorite meetings are, and why.</p>
            <img src="/content/minigamemadness/word-cloud.png" alt="Most used words to describe effective meetings.">
            <p>Overall, the users I talked to found that meetings that are engaging and help build stronger relationships among the team are the most successful, and that having a bit of fun is the best way to do that.  That feedback became the basis for a persona, which I’d use throughout the design process.</p>

            <h2>All fun and games: starting the design</h2>
            <p>One of the project requirements was to design a responsive website, which helped narrow the scope of what I was brainstorming.</p>
            <p>I landed on the idea to make a collection of short, team-focused, minigames that could be played online.  This would hit on my goals to get everyone participating, bring people closer together, and have some fun.</p>
            <p>Below is some of the ideas I had for how to find games to play on the site:</p>

            <h2>Sitemap & low-fi designs</h2>
            <p>Now that I had an idea of what I wanted my website to be, it was time to start planning the information architecture of the site and building the screens.  Looking at my persona’s goals and behaviors, I had a couple things to keep in mind when designing the IA and wireframes for the site:</p>

                <li>
                    <p class="counter">1</p>
                    <p>Site should be quick and easy to navigate.  Icebreakers often only take up a few minutes.</p>
            </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="counter">2</p>
                    <p>Users should spend the majority of time on the site playing, not picking games</p>
                </li>
                <li>
