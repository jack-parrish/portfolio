            <h2>What's the business need?</h2>
            <p>According to the CDC, fewer than 1 in 7 eat enough fruit and an even smaller proportion eat enough vegetables.</p>
            <p>At the same time, there is data to suggest that adults do want to eat healthier.  The nutrition industry is growing at a 6.6% clip per year and is projected to reach $465.4 billion by 2025.</p>
            <p>Something that helps alleviate the struggles with eating healthy has ample room to be successful.</p>

        <section id="research">
            <h2>So why do many adults struggle to eat healthy, and how might we help make it easier?</h2>
            <p>My initial hypothesis based on existing studies and research I found was that cost and perceived taste were the two largest barriers to eating healthier.</p>
            <p>To test that hypothesis, I sent a survey to members of the Healthy Food FaceBook group, a group promoting healthy eating worldwide.  I received 22 responses and followed up with 6 respondents to conduct user interviews.</p>
            <img src="/content/radiance/survey-results.png" alt="Survey results of significant barriers to healthy eating">
            <p>I synthesized common trends I heard from survey respondents and interviewees into two personas.  These personas are users who would be likely use an app to accomplish their nutrition goals, because designing a mobile app was one of the constraints for this project.</p>

            <h2>Starting the design</h2>
            <p>Since one of the project requirements was to design a mobile app and responsive website, most of my ideation was focused on what features could be built into those.</p>
            <p>I did the crazy eights exercise to brainstorm ideas for how to address my personas’ pain points within an app or website.</p>

            <p>Based on my findings during user research, I had three main goals when designing the main user flow:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Help make the process of finding, shopping for, and cooking nutritious recipes as convenient as possible</li>
                <li>Be budget-friendly and transparent about cost</li>
                <li>Keep the recipes fun, straightforward, and delicious</li>

            <h2>Testing the design</h2>
            <p>I conducted a usability study with 5 users (2 users representing the Ginny persona, and 3 representing the Carl persona) to test if they were able to complete the workflow to create a meal plan in the app and gather feedback on how effective the app is at making eating healthy easier.</p>

                <p>My initial iteration of the Plan Preview page did not meet the goal to make the app budget-friendly and transparent about cost.  I addressed this by adding the price of each ingredient at each store alongside its availability.

                <p>To make it easier for users with dietary restrictions to find recipes that fit their needs, I added labels to the recipe cards to more clearly call out when a recipe fits dietary restrictions.

            <h2>Moving this party to the web</h2>
            <p>My goal for Radiance’s responsive website was to maintain consistency with the look and feel of the mobile app, while making adjustments to take advantage of more screen real estate for tablet and desktop layouts.</p>
            <p>On mobile, the layout for the most part is the same, but the navigation bar across the bottom on the mobile app has been replaced by a traditional hamburger menu.</p>

                <h3>Impact</h3>
                <p>Overall, users I tested with said they liked many of the app’s features and felt like it would be a useful tool to help them eat healthier.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>What I learned</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This was my first project using Sketch, and I learned a lot about how it works and how it differs from the other tools we’ve used in this course</li>
                    <li>This project taught me a lot about the value of good background and user research.  Eating healthy is an issue with complicated socioeconomic challenges, so I had to put a lot of research and thought into what pain points could be helped with an app, and how to design it in such a way as to be inclusive and effective.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h2>What's next?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>A requirement for this project was to make an app and responsive website, but I’d like to research if other products or services would better help make healthy eating easier.</li>
                <li>Conduct another usability study to validate if the changes made after the first study met users needs, and gather feedback on the look and feel of the high fidelity designs.</li>
                <li>Put on my web developer hat and bring these designs to life :)</li>
            </ol>
