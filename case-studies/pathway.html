            <h2>Some context</h2>
            <p>Spaces like college campuses and convention centers can often feel stressful or congested, with thousands of people navigating through them. These spaces have multiple buildings, floors, and indoor and outdoor components, not to mention a ton of different events happening all at once.  It's easy for someone new to feel intimidated or uncomfortable.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="research">
            <h2>Why are these spaces stressful?</h2>
            <p>To try to answer this question, as well as understand the surrounding context in which users interact with these spaces, I conducted 6 user interviews.</p>
            <p>I decided to focus on new college students and professional conference attendees, because both colleges and conferences are already tech-heavy events and these users would likely benefit the most from a mobile app.</p>
            <h3>User Pain Points</h3>

                    <p>Confidence</p>
                    <p>Some users felt intimidated being in a new place away from people and places they know.</p>
                </li>
                <li>

                    <p>Accessibility</p>
                    <p>Complex and crowded spaces are particularly difficult to navigate for users with mobility disabilities.</p>
                </li>
                <li>                    
                    <p class="counter">4</p>
                    <p>Lost Indoors</p>
                    <p>Users generally felt the most anxious or uncomfortable indoors, where their phone's GPS isn't as helpful.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>I used what I learned in my interviews to map the "as is" user journey and create two personas.  The Frank persona will help me keep the needs of professionals and convention attendees in mind, while the Elaine persona will help make sure the app works for those on college campuses.</p>

            <h2>How might a new mobile app help?</h2>
            <p>Based on my research, I knew my design solution needed to help save time, build familiarity, and get people of all abilities where they need to go.  After some How Might We and Crazy Eights exercises, I decided to design a navigation app that could work both indoors and outdoors.</p>
            <p>I conducted a competitive audit of other navigation apps to identify what works well, and where my app has a chance to stand out from the crowd:</p>
