            <p>I'm a UX designer specializing in designing (and occasionally building) accessible, user-centered products that help improve user journeys through the digital world.  Iâ€™m currently looking for new opportunities to solve challenging problems, expand my UX skillset, and collaborate as a part of a team.</p>

                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Hello, my name is Jack.  I've loved thinking creatively and solving problems since I was a kid playing with Lego, but my interest in UX design came while studying engineering.  While I liked the soft engineering skills, I wanted to substitute heat exchangers with stylesheets and work more with the web.</p>
                    <p>Since 2018, I've been able to learn and practice UX design and web development as a part of my job at a healthcare software corporation.  More recently, I completed Google's UX Design Professional Certificate program.</p>
                    <p>I strive to keep the user at the heart of my design process.  Below are a few things in particular that I focus on:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Check any assumptions at the door.  What I think the problem is may not be the problem my users actually face.</li>
                        <li>Be inclusive.  A design that isn't accessible is by definition not functional.</li>
                        <li>Don't take it personally.  I'm designing for the user, not myself, and constructive feedback helps make the end product better.</li>
                    </ol>
